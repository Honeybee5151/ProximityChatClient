Hello it is me Shangapallia again. Here we have a proximity chat for rotmg-pservers created by Claude.
So for the main batch of files the navigation is src -> kabam -> rotmg -> ProximityChat.

When you have added the stuff from the server to your server, you need to add exceptions in the firewall to 2051,
both in your provider and your VPS.

//777592 is the navigation code. Basically every (should be every) new code section in files other than the batch
have the code before so that you can easily find what is needed to implement.

Bugs:

Easy change:
