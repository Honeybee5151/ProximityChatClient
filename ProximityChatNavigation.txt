Hello it is me Shangapallia again. Here we have a proximity chat for rotmg-pservers created by Claude.
So for the main batch of files the navigation is src -> kabam -> rotmg -> ProximityChat.


//777592 is the navigation code. Basically every (should be every) new code section in files other than the batch
have the code before so that you can easily find what is needed to implement.

Bugs:

1. Sometimes mics that should not be detected by the visualiser are shown working.
2. Sometimes when using push to talk, it gets stuck on, "On" when switching back to normal communcation, and when switch
ing mic.
3. The "On"/"Off", of push to talk is not that real time interactive.

(MAYBE FIXED NOW)
